I am an assistant professor in [Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). 
My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (<b>NLP</b>) and Artificial Intelligence (<b>AI</b>). 

I am interested in data-centric NLP and topics such as <i>unit testing for NLP and AI, dynamic evaluation frameworks for NLP models, adversarial attacks for NLP, data augmentation and data generation.</i>

My current projects span across problems such as <b>natural language understanding, theory of mind and AI, automatic fact checking, and algorithmic fairness</b>.

Before joining UoB in February 2023, I was a postdoc at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I received my PhD from the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/web/ub/) where I worked on natural language understanding and vector space models of semantics.
